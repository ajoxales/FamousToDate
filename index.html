            <p>
              Have you seen the viral interview of the man who took a cell phone
              left unattended in a canteen in Ermita, Manila? He was caught in
              the act via CCTV but he vehemently denied it, reasoning that he
              merely took what was in front of him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Netizens began to condemn the man, but things took a turn when
              someone spotted that the suspect wore a PWD identification card.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man's name is Peejay Dela Cruz, but he is known online as
              Otlum, the Tagalog word "multo" (ghost) spelled backwards. In an
              episode of "Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho," Otlum shared the story of
              his life and confirmed that he has a psychosocial disability.
